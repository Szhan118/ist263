        <p>About me...</p>
        <p>Hi, my name is Shuotong Zhang, and my English name is Avril. 
            My family is from China, and I immigrated to United States when I was 9 years old.
            My family and I communicate in Chinese, and therefore I'm bilingual with English and Chinese. 
            I am the only child, and I always felt lonely since my parents are always busy. 
            Therefore, I end up having two turtle as my 17th birthday, Coconut and Papaya. 
            I always wanted to own a dog, and finally by this summer, my parents agreed me to have my dog. 
            Now, I have two dogs, one is Siberian Husky - Kayn, and one is Lhasa Apso - Cupid. </p>
