        <h1>Project Idea</h1>
        <p>My project will be an informational site on how to choose the best food for your dog.  Since my concentration is on web design, I can show this website during my job interview or when I’m applying for internships as my ability of building websites.  I personally own two dogs, and they each have their own customized dog foods according to their breed, size, activity level, and allergies. The main idea behind this project is that I hope creating this website can help some dog owners to find the right food for their dogs. Four pages I will have:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Home page – describes what the website does</li>
                    <ul><li>Content type: text, image</li></ul>
                <li>Dry food page – rank of dry foods</li>
                    <ul><li>Content type: text, image,links</li></ul>
                <li>Wet food page – rank of wet foods</li>
                    <ul><li>Content type: text, image,links</li></ul>
                <li>Homemade recipe – 5min recipes that can be made at home</li>
                    <ul><li>Content type: text, image,links</li></ul>
            </ol>
            <ul><li>Image source: Google</li>
                <li>Link source: Chewy.com, petsmart.com, petco.com</li>
                <li>Information source: dogfoodadviser.com</li>
            </ul>
